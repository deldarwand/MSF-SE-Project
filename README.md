# MSF-SE-Project

MediDroid is an application that makes use of drones, enhanced with sensors and cameras, to provide users with data and video footage. With this new perspective, we can give organisations like Médecins Sans Frontières a new tool to work in critical regions. Using MediDroid, you can:
 - visualise data from drone sensors
 - control the camera from the Cardboard headset
 - indicate points of interest near the user

To successfully set up and use the system you will need:
 - a drone
 - an Android phone
 - a Google Cardboard
 - a camera on a 2-rotor gimbal
 - a video transmitter and receiver
 - a data transmitter and receiver
 - an ADC converter
 - two batteries
 - the desired sensors

For setting up the system, see the guide below:
